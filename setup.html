<u>Initial steps</u>
</p>
<p>
Before getting started I want to make sure that online traing is right for you. Always consult your doctor before starting an exercise program. That way your doctor can give me guidance when starting your training plan. We'll also want to identify any previous injuries or restrictions. Some of these I can work with, but if you have a more serious problem, I would recommend seeing a trainer in person to get you to a point where you should be. If any of the following apply to you, then I would recommend seeing a trainer in person rather than starting an online program.
<br>
<ul>
	<li>You are in a rehabilitative state - With in person training things can be fine tuned to fit your needs better than online training</li>
	<br>
	<li>You are a high performance athlete - It would be tough to get you to where you need to be with online training</li>
	<br>
	<li>You have never exercised before - As a complete beginner, it's important that you have proper form and get the feel of it, so in person training would serve you better</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<u>Set up and video call</u>
</p>
<p>
Once you have determined that you are a good fit for online training, fill out the form at the bottom of this page and I will get in contact with you schedule a video call. Then I can get to know you and we can go over your fitness goals. This is when we can go over any questions or concerns that you may have.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
<u>Starting your plan</u>
</p>
<p>
I'll send you your personalized workout plan though an app called trainerize which has videos on how to properly do each exercise. You can stay in contact with me directly through the app and let me know if a workout is too hard or easy, or if you have any problems with the exercises themselves. Then I can adjust the plan accordingly.
