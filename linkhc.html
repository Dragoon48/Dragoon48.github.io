<h2>What is Health Coaching?</h2>
<p>
  Building new habits related to nutrition, exercise, and mindfulness can be tough to implement. With conflicting health advice and a busy schedule it can be difficult to know where to start. Working with a health coach can help you sort out your goals and create long lasting habits towards a healthier future. As your health coach we'll work together to:
<br>
- Create sustainable healthy habits that fit your unique lifestyle, preferences, and goals
  <br>
- Navigate nutrition choices with confidence, without restrictive diets or guilt
  <br>
- Design an revitalizing physical activity routine that fits into your schedule
  <br>
- Manage stress and improve sleep quality for better overall wellbeing
  <br>
- Stay accountable and motivated as you work toward your health goals
</p>
    <p>
Health coaching bridges the gap between medical advice and real-life implementation. While doctors tell you what to do, I help you develop a plan to get it done. Through regular one on one sessions, we'll:
  <br>
1. Identify your primary wellness goals
  <br>
2. Develop personalized strategies that work with your schedule and preferences
  <br>
3. Break down big habit changes into manageable steps
  <br>
4. Problem solve obstacles as they arise
  <br>
5. Celebrate progress and adjust plans as needed
</p>
    <p>
      Studies show that people who work with health coaches are significantly more likely to achieve and maintain their wellness goals. My coaching provides the structure, accountability, and guidance to help you make lasting changes.
